<h1>Lossy & lossles</h1>
<h2>Lossy compression</h2>
<article>Lossy compression refers to compression in which some of the data from the original file (JPEG) is lost.
  The process is irreversible, once you convert to lossy, you can't go back.
  And the more you compress it, the more degradation occurs. JPEGs and GIFs are both lossy image formats.
  By default WordPress uses a lossy compression rate of 90 percent to optimize JPEG images when creating preview images.
  You can change this using the filter jpeg_quality in your functions.php file.</article><br />

  <article> One of the biggest obvious benefits to using lossy compression is that it results in a significantly reduced file size (smaller than lossless compression method),
  but it also means there is quality loss. Most tools, plugins, and software out there will let you choose the degree of compression you want to use.
  In our example below we took an image and applied different compression ratios to it.
  You can see there is a big decrease in the size of the images which is great.
  But you can also see the image degrade in quality as you apply higher ratios of compression.</article>

<h3>Lossy advantages and disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages: Very small file sizes and lots of tools, plugins, and software support it.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: Quality degrades with higher ratio of compression. Can't get original back after compressing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lossles compression</h2>

Lossless compression refers to compression in which the image is reduced without any quality loss.
Usually this is done by removing unnecessary metadata from JPEG and PNG files. RAW, BMP, GIF, and PNG are all lossless image formats.
It is important to note that since JPEGs are a lossy format that when using the "maximum" preset in Photoshop, this doesn't mean it is lossless.
However, even images exported from Photoshop using the "Save for Web" function can still see significant reductions.

The big benefit to lossless compression is that you can retain the quality of your image and still achieve a smaller file size.
We took the same image again and ran it through our Optimus Image Optimizer plugin, which uses lossless compression.
It also creates progressive JPEGs.

<h3>Lossles advantages and disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages: No loss of quality, slight decreases in image file sizes.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: Larger files than if you were to use lossy compression.</li>
</ul>
